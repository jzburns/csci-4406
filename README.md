# Welcome to csci-4406

Here you will find some sample ARM32 assembly code. The recommended environment for running the samples is [cpulator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm)

1. You are free to use any of these code samples as the basis for homework, personal projects and self-directed learning
1. [Rapid Tables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html?x=96) are a great way to check your base conversions
1. [ARM instructions set docs](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0013/d/Introduction-to-Assembly-Language/The-ARM-instruction-sets) are a good place to start.
1. [This is a great youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@lauriewired) for those wanting a slower pace
